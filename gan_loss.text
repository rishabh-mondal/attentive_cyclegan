✅ 1️⃣ Expected Behavior of Losses During Training
Loss Name	What It Represents	How It Should Change?
Generator G Loss (G_loss)	How well G(X → Y) fools D_Y	🔻 Decrease (but remain balanced with D_Y)
Generator F Loss (F_loss)	How well F(Y → X) fools D_X	🔻 Decrease (but remain balanced with D_X)
Discriminator X Loss (D_X_loss)	How well D_X distinguishes real from fake X	🔻 Should fluctuate, but stay stable
Discriminator Y Loss (D_Y_loss)	How well D_Y distinguishes real from fake Y	🔻 Should fluctuate, but stay stable
Cycle Consistency Loss (Cycle_loss)	How well G(F(Y)) ≈ Y and F(G(X)) ≈ X	🔻 Should decrease, but not too much
Identity Loss (Identity_loss)	How well images keep their original style	🔻 Should decrease, but stay small

✅ 2️⃣ Understanding Loss Trends
🔹 What Does a "Good" Training Look Like?

Generator losses (G_loss, F_loss) should slowly decrease (but not go to 0).
Discriminator losses (D_X_loss, D_Y_loss) should stabilize (fluctuate between 0.2 - 0.6).
Cycle Consistency & Identity loss should decrease but not go to 0.
🔹 Possible Issues & Fixes

Issue	Symptom	Fix
Mode Collapse (Generators cheat by producing the same images)	G_loss & F_loss drop too fast, D_X_loss & D_Y_loss drop to 0	Increase G_lr, use Spectral Norm in D, add noise
Overpowered Discriminators	D_X_loss & D_Y_loss → 0.01, G_loss & F_loss keep increasing	Reduce D_lr (1e-5), use label smoothing (0.9 instead of 1.0)
Poor Image Quality	Cycle_loss & Identity_loss stay high (> 1000)	Lower λ_cycle to 5.0, lower λ_id to 0.1
